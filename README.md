# Work Day Scheduler

## Description:

This project uses the dayjs library to present the user with the current date, and track the current time to create a Work Day Scheduler that tracks the current time throughout the day

The following screenshot demonstrates the application functionality:

The present hour block is shown in Red, past hour blocks are shown in gray, and future blocks are shown in green. 

Users may enter items into each hour block, and hit the blue save button to save their input
